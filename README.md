# 🖥️ Cuberto Clone  

🚀 **Live Demo**: [Cuberto Clone](https://cuberto-beta.vercel.app/)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **React.js clone** of the Cuberto website, focusing on clean UI, smooth animations, and modern web interactions. The goal was to replicate key sections of Cuberto while practicing advanced frontend development.  

## ✨ Sections Implemented  
✔️ **Home Page** – Fully responsive hero section with engaging design  
✔️ **Home Page Video Section** – Auto-playing background video  
✔️ **How We Work Section** – Animated workflow with smooth transitions  
✔️ **Feature Projects Section** – Showcasing projects with hover effects  
✔️ **Footer Section** – Styled footer matching Cuberto's theme  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **React.js** – Component-based architecture for modular development  
- **Framer Motion** – High-performance animations and smooth transitions   
- **GSAP (GreenSock)** – Advanced animations for page elements  
- **React Router** – Seamless navigation between sections  

## 🏆 Challenges & Solutions  
### 1️⃣ **Smooth Animations**  
**Issue**: Replicating Cuberto’s fluid animations was difficult.  
**Solution**: Used **Framer Motion** and **GSAP** for optimized, lag-free transitions.  

### 2️⃣ **Video Autoplay & Performance**  
**Issue**: The background video was causing performance drops.  
**Solution**: Used **lazy loading** and **optimized video compression**.  

### 3️⃣ **Hover & Cursor Effects**  
**Issue**: Creating an interactive cursor that adapts to different sections.  
**Solution**: Implemented a **custom cursor using React state & event listeners**.
